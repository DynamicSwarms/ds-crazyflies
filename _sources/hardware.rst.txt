It is recommended to use a `Crazyradio 2.0 <https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyradio-2-0/>`_ for this library. 
Make sure to follow the `Getting started with the Crazyradio 2.0 <https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-crazyradio-2-0/>`_ guide.
Upload the latest CRPA emulation firmware (tested with `V1.2 <https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyradio2-firmware/releases/tag/1.2>`_)


If you are using a `Crazyradio PA <https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyradio-pa/>`_ specific firmware, only the `Crazyswarm <https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm>`_ or 
`Crazyswarm 2 <https://github.com/IMRCLab/crazyswarm2>`_ prebuilt folder needs to be used. This special firmware has the necessary broadcasting features implemented.
