Configuration
*************

Start by configuring the hardware as well as the software components.

.. note::
   If you only want to use the simulation, you can skip this section and skip to :doc:`Usage </usage>` section immediately.

Hardware
--------

   
   If you want to use real hardware, you need to configure your Crazyradio, Crazyflies (and motion capture system).

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 1

      crazyradio
      crazyflie

Software
--------

   Lastly you need to configure the software. This includes setting up the motion capture system, as well as the Crazyflie configuration.

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 1

      crazyflie_configuration
      motion_capture
      implementation
