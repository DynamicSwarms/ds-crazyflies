Configuration
*************

Start by configuring the hardware as well as the software components.

- Hardware 

   If you only want to use the simulation, you can skip this section.
   If you want to use real hardware, you need to configure your Crazyradio, Crazyflies (and motion capture system).

      crazyflie

- Software

   Lastly you need to configure the software. This includes setting up the motion capture system, as well as the Crazyflie configuration.
