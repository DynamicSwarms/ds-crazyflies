#. If you have not already done so install `ROS 2 Humble <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html>`_ on your system.

#. If you plan to use the webots installations

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt-get install ros-humble-webots-ros2

#. These dependencies are required:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt-get install ros-humble-tf-transformations

#. Clone the `ds-crazyflies <https://github.com/DynamicSwarms/ds-crazyflies>`_ repository 

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/DynamicSwarms/ds-crazyflies.git

#. Before building this repository the submodules need to be initialized

   .. code-block:: bash

      git submodule update --init --recursive

#. Source your ROS installation

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

#. Install colcon

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

#. Build the software stack 

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      sh build.sh

.. note:: Because of the dependency structure, ``colcon build`` can not be executed directly. If you only want to build the ``crazyflies`` package, use: ``colcon build --packages-select crazyflies``
