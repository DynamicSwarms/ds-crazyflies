The Dynamic Swarms Crazyflie project is a fully ROS2 based software stack that allows you to control multiple `Crazyflies <https://www.bitcraze.io/>`_ simultaneously.
The project was heavily inspired by the `Crazyswarm <https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `Crazyswarm 2 <https://imrclab.github.io/crazyswarm2/>`_ projects.
It provides the ability to safely add and remove Crazyflies while the system is running. It is completely ROS2 based and allows you to access the radio directly.

In our development of a Crazyfly Swarm Middleware with up to 50 Crazyflies, which are charged with the QI-Charging Deck, we modified the `Crazyswarm <https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ project heavily to meet our needs.
to suit our needs. A key feature we needed was the ability to add and remove Crazyflies at runtime.

As ROS Noetic had reached it's end of life and we were about to move to ROS 2, we had to decide whether to integrate our changes into Crazyswarm2 or use the knowledge gained to develop our own software stack. 
The Crazyswarm2 implementation did not come with any improvements regarding our specific needs, so we decided to develop this project.

This package also provides a `Webots <https://cyberbotics.com/>`_ simulation interface so that simulated Crazyflies and real hardware Crazyflies can be used interchangeably.

The following was created using our modified version of Crazyswarm.

What is the difference to `Crazyswarm 2 <https://imrclab.github.io/crazyswarm2/>`_?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The crazyswarm2 project, specifically the cpp implementation, is implemented as a monolithic ROS node.
This makes it difficult to modify and adapt the library to specific needs. 
A major difference is that crazyflie functionalities, such as ``takeoff'', are not implemented as services but as topics.
This allows user code to be completely independent of the implementation, avoiding deadlocks when a crazyflie fails.
Especially if you do not know your swarm configuration at startup, the Crazyswarm(2) implementation is not suitable.

When should I use this library instead of `Crazyswarm 2 <https://imrclab.github.io/crazyswarm2/>`_?

* Do you want to add or remove Crazyflies during runtime?
* Do you want to change your configuration at runtime, such as logging variables??
* Want to have low-level access to the CRTP protocol directly from ROS?
